# PasswordGenerator
This is a Password generator project. I was provided with a starter java script code. 
My job was to add prompts that instructed the user on their ideal password and also ask them of what they needed to be included in their password. After which I captured their desired password length and connected it with the final "for loop" that did a random pick on their password considering the length they provided.

Here is the desired steps
1. Ask their name
2. Give the user the requirements of a password
3. Ask them if they want an uppercase, lowercase,, numbers and special characters
4. Ask them how many characters they want their password to contain.
5. Password is generated using the data obtained from step 4
